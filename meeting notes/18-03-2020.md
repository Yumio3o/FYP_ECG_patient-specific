# Discussion summary
- Using Google Colab Notebook to build up the deep learning model to fix the problem which we can't use the GPU computer
- We may change the coding language to Matlab.
- We try change the algorithm without using neural networks

# To do
- Decide whether we need to using python 3 or Matlab as the main coding language.
- Record the accuracy.
- Comfirm the accuracy.

# Finish item
- Using SVM algorithm the instead of neural networks
- We download the data from the database which from Physionet(PTB Diagnostic ECG Database) and convert the file to .csv file because of the model need .csv file.
- The alternative plan is use Matlab.
- We buy more AD8232 ECG collecting chip and 50 sheet patch so that we can conduct a live demo.

# Challenges
- Time limited, we need to set a plan of developing.
- Because the virus, we cannot back to campus to use our lab gpu computer, we need to decide keeping or changing the algorithm.
- Can't run fast with labtop, we need to come back to using the lab gpu computer.
- We may need to do the project from 0 again because we may change the coding language.

# Schedule
- Next Meeting:TBC
