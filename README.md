# The patient-specific arryhythmia recognition
- 特定使用者基於心電圖（ECG）信號的心律失常識別
- This project is the Graduation Project / Final Year Project (FYP) of Department of Computer and Information Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau.

# Abstract
- At present, the medical equipment for the physical examination is very complete. There are various equipments in the hospital, including electrocardiogram, computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, etc. These devices are bulky and expensive to purchase, and the general public needs to go to a hospital or a specific clinic to check their physical condition.
- For our goal, we need to build a software to detect whether this person has heart disease. We hope that each user can quickly detect what potential heart disease they may have at a low cost, fast and simple risk.
-目前，用於身體檢查的醫療設備非常齊全。 醫院中有各種設備，包括心電圖，計算機斷層掃描，超聲，磁共振成像等。這些設備體積龐大且購買昂貴，並且公眾需要去醫院或特定診所檢查身體狀況 。
-為了實現我們的目標，我們需要構建一個軟件來檢測此人是否患有心髒病。 我們希望每個用戶都能以低成本，快速而簡單的風險快速檢測出他們可能患有的潛在心髒病。
